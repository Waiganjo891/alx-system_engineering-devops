0x0C. Web server

In this project, some of the tasks will be graded on 2 aspects:

Is your web-01 server configured according to requirements
Does your answer file contain a Bash script that automatically performs commands to configure an Ubuntu machine to fit requirements (meaning without any human intervention)
For example, if I need to create a file /tmp/test containing the string hello world and modify the configuration of Nginx to listen on port 8080 instead of 80, I can use emacs on my server to create the file and to modify the Nginx configuration file /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default.

But my answer file would contain:

Task 0
Write a Bash script that transfers a file from our client to a server:
Requirements:
Accepts 4 parameters
The path to the file to be transferred
The IP of the server we want to transfer the file to
The username scp connects with
The path to the SSH private key that scp uses
Display Usage: 0-transfer_file PATH_TO_FILE IP USERNAME PATH_TO_SSH_KEY if less than 3 parameters passed
scp must transfer the file to the user home directory ~/
Strict host key checking must be disabled when using scp

Task 1
Web servers are the piece of software generating and serving HTML pages, let’s install one!
Requirements:
Install nginx on your web-01
server
Nginx should be listening on port 80
When querying Nginx at its root / with a GET request (requesting a page) using curl, it must return a page that contains the string Hello World!
As an answer file, write a Bash script that configures a new Ubuntu machine to respect above requirements (this script will be run on the server itself)
You can’t use systemctl for restarting nginx

Task 2
mandatory
.TECH Domains is one of the top domain providers. They are known for the stability and quality of their DNS hosting solution. We partnered with .TECH Domains so that you can learn about DNS.

Task 3
Configure your Nginx server so that /redirect_me is redirecting to another page.
Requirements:
The redirection must be a “301 Moved Permanently”
You answer file should be a Bash script containing commands to automatically configure a Ubuntu machine to respect above requirements
Using what you did with 1-install_nginx_web_server, write 3-redirection so that it configures a brand new Ubuntu machine to the requirements asked in this task

Task 4
Configure your Nginx server to have a custom 404 page that contains the string Ceci n'est pas une page.
Requirements:
The page must return an HTTP 404 error code
The page must contain the string Ceci n'est pas une page
Using what you did with 3-redirection, write 4-not_found_page_404 so that it configures a brand new Ubuntu machine to the requirements asked in this task

Task 5
Time to practice configuring your server with Puppet! Just as you did before, we’d like you to install and configure an Nginx server using Puppet instead of Bash. To save time and effort, you should also include resources in your manifest to perform a 301 redirect when querying /redirect_me.
Requirements:
Nginx should be listening on port 80
When querying Nginx at its root / with a GET request (requesting a page) using curl, it must return a page that contains the string Hello World!
The redirection must be a “301 Moved Permanently”
Your answer file should be a Puppet manifest containing commands to automatically configure an Ubuntu machine to respect above requirements
